## Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in time series data using advanced deep learning algorithms, specifically LSTM autoencoders. Anomalies in time series data can indicate significant deviations from normal patterns, which can be critical for various applications such as financial fraud detection, equipment maintenance, and network monitoring.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Yahoo Finance Stock Dataset, which provides historical stock market data for various companies. The dataset contains attributes such as date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, and company name. By leveraging this rich dataset, we aim to identify abnormal fluctuations or patterns in stock prices that may indicate potential anomalies or irregularities.

## Project Goals
- Implement a deep learning-based anomaly detection system using LSTM autoencoders.
- Explore the effectiveness of LSTM autoencoders in capturing temporal dependencies and identifying anomalies in time series data.
- Develop techniques for preprocessing time series data and handling imbalanced classes to improve anomaly detection performance.
- Evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection system using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
- Provide insights and recommendations for practical applications of anomaly detection in financial markets and beyond.
